Open Solo 2.5-RC4 Clean Install (CONTROLLER)
(December 23, 2017 / MCL)

This package contains Open Solo 2.5-RC4 for beta testing! This package will update the recovery partition (aka factory rest partition, aka golden image) of the IMX companion computer's SD card on the CONTROLLER. It also tags it to execute a factory reset on the next reboot. You will also need to install the Copter package if you haven't already done so.

Detailed instructions can be found in the release notes on github: https://github.com/OpenSolo/documentation/releases/. If you have not completely read and understood those instructions, cancel this installation and read the instructions first.

1. Press the Install button below.
2. Wait for scripts to run and files to load.
3. Reboot solo and controller when *both* packages have completed successfully
