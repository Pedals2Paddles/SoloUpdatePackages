Photo Events Logging

Whenever a photo is taken on the Solo in Photo mode, send a message to connected apps to notify them of the location and time. This is used with the Geotag Editor, an add-on, but can be useful without it.

Note: This feature is included in Open Solo.  If you have Open Solo, you do not need to install this separately.

1. Press the Install button below.
2. Power cycle the Solo when complete.
