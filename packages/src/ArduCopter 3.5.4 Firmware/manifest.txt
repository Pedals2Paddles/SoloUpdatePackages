ArduCopter 3.5.4 Firmware
(January 1, 2018 / MCL)

This package contains ArduCopter 3.5.4 firmware for the Solo's Pixhawk 2.1 Green Cube, with the Solo's required default parameters built in. Since parameter defaults are built in, when you do a parameter reset, it will put them back to the correct defaults. This also has a few patches that will be part of 3.5.5, but are included here in advance.

The ArduCopter 3.5.x Parameter package is no longer needed with this firmware since it has them built in.  However, if you have the HERE or landing gear mods, you would need to reload those specific parameter packages after a parameter reset.  Those mods are obviously not built in by default.

This is not compatible with a stock Solo Pixhawk 2.0!

1. Press the Install button below. Firmware will be copied to the Solo.
2. When prompted, power cycle the Solo.
3. Firmware will begin install on reboot.
4. When complete, Solo will beep several times.
5. Solo and controller will reconnect when complete.

A few things to be aware of:
- If install process doesn't complete after 5 minutes, power cycle Solo.
- A few people have had to power cycle 2-3 times. This is ok.
- If solo & controller don't reconnect when done, power cycle both.
